        A banana is an elongated, edible fruit: botanically a berryproduced by several kinds of large herbaceous
        flowering plants in the genus Musa.
        In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas.

        Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have been first domesticated in
        Papua New Guinea.
        They are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine,
        and banana beer and as ornamental plants.
        The world's largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China, which together accounted for
        approximately 38% of total production

        Banana leaves are large, flexible, and waterproof. While generally too tough to actually be eaten, they are
        often used as ecologically friendly disposable food containers or as "plates" in South Asia and several
        Southeast Asian countries.
